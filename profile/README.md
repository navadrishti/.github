## 🚀 What is Navadrishti?

Navadrishti is **not a volunteering platform**.  
It is a **full-stack operating system for the social impact ecosystem** — built to modernize how NGOs, corporates, volunteers, and communities **plan, execute, measure, and scale impact**.

Today, social impact work is fragmented across:
- Word documents
- Excel sheets
- PDFs
- Emails
- WhatsApp groups
- Manual reporting
- Disconnected tools

**Navadrishti replaces this chaos with one intelligent, integrated platform.**

## 🎯 The Problem We Are Solving

India spends **₹25,000+ crore annually on CSR**, yet:

- NGOs struggle with operations, documentation, and visibility
- Corporates struggle with CSR planning, compliance, and impact reporting
- Volunteers struggle to prove and track real social impact
- Impact data is scattered, unverifiable, and underutilized
- Most “platforms” stop at volunteering or donations

👉 **The sector lacks an operating system.**

---

We enable stakeholders to:
- Design structured social projects
- Match skills to real needs
- Track execution in real time
- Measure outcomes, not just activities
